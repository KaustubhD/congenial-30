  <script>
    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let num1 = 20
    let num2 = num1
    console.log(num1, num2)

    num1 = 40
    console.log(num1, num2)


    let str1 = 'Skrrrt'
    let str2 = str1
    console.log(str1, str2)

    str1 = 'Gucci Gang'
    console.log(str1, str2)


    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players
    console.log(players, team)

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[2] = 'Alpha'  //Changes both team and players

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice()

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]

    // or use Array API
    const team5 = Array.from(players)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team4[4] = 'New Guy'

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Bill Clinton',
      age: 20
    };

    // const president = person
    // president.quality = 'Faithful'

    // console.log(person, president)


    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const pres2 = Object.assign({}, person, {quality: 'Faithful'})
    console.log(person, pres2) 

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const pres3 = {...person}
    console.log(person, pres2)

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const me = {
      name: 'Who knows',
      age: 'Somewhat new',
      qualities: {
        positive: 'Lazy',
        negative: 'Team Player'
      }
    }

    const me2 = Object.assign({}, me) // Shallow copy. Try changing the qualities object in one of these
    const me3 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(me)) // Deep copy. Everything new
